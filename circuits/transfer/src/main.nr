    Here we adopt a simpler approach than the multistep approach proposed in the Zether paper, for a better UX: 
    an attacker who tries to DOS the sender should at least pay 1 token to either original sender or receiver. 
    The "1" threshold could be changed to ensure correct economic incentives, typically this should be at least 
    a multiple of the average gas price of a transfer transaction. another more straightforward solution to 
    front-running would be simply to do the homomorphic addition in the smart contract rather than the circuit, 
    but this is too expensive today on Ethereum, according to the Zeestar paper §III :
